<h2>About</h2>
<p>
DVDImport is a tool for copying the content, unaltered, from a video DVD to a MPEG2 program stream file. It extracts MPEG2 video from the VOB file, transcodes the audio to MPEG1 Layer 2, and muxes the audio and video back into a single MPEG2 file. 
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>

To use DVDImport insert a DVD into your computer. The title and program chains for each title are displayed. You can click on each program chain, and click the 'Import' button. Now you will be prompted to save the file and importing will begin.

You can adjust the audio options for importing. Changing the "Level" will change the volume of the transcoded audio. You can also normalize or compress the audio level. If you have a problem with AV Sync on the imported MPEG2, you can use the "Sync" slider to adjustthe offset. This is a trail and error process.
